The system programming of Raspberry Pi can be roughly divided into two categories. The first category uses the official programming tool Raspberry Pi Imager, and the second category uses third-party programming tools. The difference between the two is that the former is provided by the official, easy to operate, and easy to choose the system; the advantage of the latter is that the system that can be burned is not limited to the system provided by the official, and the choice is diverse, but you need to find the system yourself.

# Burning steps:

Hardware: SD card with capacity above 8G, SD card reader
