Yor Forger (ヨル・フォージャー, Yoru Fōjā?), née Briar (ブライア, Buraia?) is the tritagonist of the SPY x FAMILY series. While she works as an ordinary clerk at Berlint City Hall, she also leads a secret life as a Garden assassin with the code name "Thorn Princess" (〈いばら姫〉).

Yor is a very beautiful, graceful, and fairly tall young woman with a slender yet curvaceous frame. She has long, straight black hair reaching her mid-back with short bangs framing her forehead and upturned red eyes. She splits her hair into two parts and crosses it over her head, securing it with a headband and forming two thick locks of hair that reach below her chest.[6]

At home, Yor generally wears a semi-backless red off-shoulder sweater with black tights, a red skirt, and brown-heeled ankle boots. She wears a white headband and a pair of dangling gold earrings in the shape of small spikes. When going outside, she wears a long beige coat with black buttons over her clothes.

At Berlint City Hall, she wears the standard work uniform, consisting of a long-sleeved white shirt with a sleeveless green vest over it, a knee-length green office skirt, and black heels.

As an assassin, Yor wears a form-fitting halter-style black dress that shows off her shoulders and cleavage, with a rose choker and a red rose pattern on the inside of her skirt. The front of the skirt is mid-thigh length, while the back reaches below her knees. She also wears a pair of black thigh-high boots with a rose symbol at the bottom of their sole and black fingerless gloves. The headband she wears is gold colored with a rose and two spikes on each side. Her weapons are of the same color as well.
